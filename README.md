# Personal-Profolio
A repository for all my Portfolio Projects, Contains shorter code segments used to solve various problems, along with links to any larger projects.

Each Folder is a different problem/project, in each one is another README which explains the purpose and summarizes the folder. If a folder has a Links.txt file it contains links to files that do not fit within this respository, such as: repositories for other projects, slideshows, and dashboards.
